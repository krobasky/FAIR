# Swagger generated server for FAIR Assessment Tools

## Overview
1. if you're using a cloud-provider VM instance:
a. Add a security rule to open a <port> on which your nodejs server can listen
b. Add a static IP to your instance
2. Replace the following lines in the api/swagger.yaml with your own hostname and port:
host: "18.220.156.186:8089"
3. start the server, as below


This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.

### Running the server
To run the server, run:

```
npm start
```

To view the Swagger UI interface:

```
open http://<hostname>:<port>/docs
```

This project leverages the mega-awesome [swagger-tools](https://github.com/apigee-127/swagger-tools) middleware which does most all the work.
